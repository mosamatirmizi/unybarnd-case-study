# L4 Analytics

Produce wide aggregated tables, machine-learning feature sets, or other downstream-ready assets that leverage the semantic layer. Persist results in the `l4_analytics` schema. Treat this layer as optional per use case. This layer will ensure fast adhoc-analytic access and also act as the confirmation for the downstream ETL completness.
